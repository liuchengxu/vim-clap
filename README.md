Vim-clap is a modern generic interactive finder and dispatcher, based on the newly feature: `floating_win` of neovim or `popup` of vim. The goal of vim-clap is to work everywhere out of the box, with fast response.

## Caveats

- Vim-clap is in a very early stage, breaking changes and bugs are expected.

- The Windows support is not fully tested. The providers without using any system related command should work smoothly, that is to say, most sync providers are just able to work. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) if you run into any error in Windows. And any help would be appreciated.

- Although a lot of effort has been made to unify the behavior of vim-clap between vim and neovim, and most part works in the same way, it just can't be exactly the same, for `floating_win` and `popup` are actually two different things anyway.

## Requirement

- Vim: `:echo has('patch-8.1.2114')`.
- NeoVim: `:echo has('nvim-0.4.2')`.

## Installation

### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'liuchengxu/vim-clap'

" Build the extra binary if cargo exists on your system.
Plug 'liuchengxu/vim-clap', { 'do': ':Clap install-binary' }

" The bang version will try to download the prebuilt binary if cargo does not exist.
Plug 'liuchengxu/vim-clap', { 'do': ':Clap install-binary!' }
```

The `do` hook for installing the extra binary is highly recommended, which can mostly help you get a performant vim-clap easily. If that does not work for you, please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installing the optional dependencies manually.

## Usage

Vim-clap is utterly easy to use, just type, press Ctrl-J/K to locate the wanted entry, and press Enter to apply and exit. The default settings should work well for most people in most cases, but it's absolutely hackable too.

### Commands

The paradigm is `Clap [provider_id_or_alias] {provider_args}`, where the `provider_id_or_alias` is obviously either the name or alias of provider. Technically the `provider_id` can be anything that can be used a key of a Dict, but I recommend you using an _identifier_ like name as the provider id, and use the alias rule if you prefer a special name.

- The command with a superscript `!` means that it is not yet implemented or not tested.

- The command with a superscript `+` means that it supports multi-selection via <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

- Use `:Clap grep ++query=<cword>` to grep the word under cursor.

[Send a pull request](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pulls) if you want to get your provider listed here.

### Global variables

- `g:clap_layout`: Dict, `{ 'width': '67%', 'height': '33%', 'row': '33%', 'col': '17%' }` by default. This variable controls the size and position of vim-clap window. By default, the vim-clap window is placed relative to the currently active window. To make it relative to the whole editor modify this variable as shown below:

  ```vim
  let g:clap_layout = { 'relative': 'editor' }
  ```

- `g:clap_open_action`: Dict, `{ 'ctrl-t': 'tab split', 'ctrl-x': 'split', 'ctrl-v': 'vsplit' }`, extra key bindings for opening the selected file in a different way. NOTE: do not define a key binding which is conflicted with the other default bindings of vim-clap, and only `ctrl-*` is supported for now.

- `g:clap_provider_alias`: Dict, if you don't want to invoke some clap provider by its id(name), as it's too long or somehow, you can add an alias for that provider.

  ```vim
  " The provider name is `command_history`, with the following alias config,
  " now you can call it via both `:Clap command_history` and `:Clap hist:`.
  let g:clap_provider_alias = {'hist:': 'command_history'}
  ```

- `g:clap_selected_sign`: Dict, `{ 'text': ' >', 'texthl': "WarningMsg", "linehl": "ClapSelected"}`.

- `g:clap_current_selection_sign`: Dict, `{ 'text': '>>', 'texthl': "WarningMsg", "linehl": "ClapCurrentSelection"}`.

- `g:clap_no_matches_msg`: String, `'NO MATCHES FOUND'`, message to show when there is no matches found.

- `g:clap_popup_input_delay`: Number, `200ms` by default, delay for actually responsing to the input, vim only.

- `g:clap_disable_run_rooter`: Bool, `v:false`, vim-clap by default will try to run from the project root by changing `cwd` temporarily. Set it to `v:true` to run from the origin `cwd`. The project root here means the git base directory. Create an issue if you want to see more support about the project root.

The option naming convention for provider is `g:clap_provider_{provider_id}_{opt}`.

- `g:clap_provider_grep_delay`: 300ms by default, delay for actually spawning the grep job in the background.

- `g:clap_provider_grep_blink`: [2, 100] by default, blink 2 times with 100ms timeout when jumping the result. Set it to [0, 0] to disable the blink.

- `g:clap_provider_grep_opts`: An empty string by default, allows you to enable flags such as `'--hidden -g "!.git/"'`.

See `:help clap-options` for more information.

### Keybindings

- [x] Use <kbd>Ctrl-j</kbd>/<kbd>Down</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl-k</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd> to navigate the result list up and down linewise.
- [x] Use <kbd>PageDown</kbd>/<kbd>PageUp</kbd> to scroll the result list down and up.
- [x] Use <kbd>Ctrl-a</kbd>/<kbd>Home</kbd> to go to the start of the input.
- [x] Use <kbd>Ctrl-e</kbd>/<kbd>End</kbd> to go to the end of the input.
- [x] Use <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl-g</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl-[</kbd> or <kbd>Esc</kbd> to exit.
- [x] Use <kbd>Ctrl-h</kbd>/<kbd>BS</kbd> to delete previous character.
- [x] Use <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd> to delete next character.
- [x] Use <kbd>Ctrl-b</kbd> to move cursor left one character.
- [x] Use <kbd>Ctrl-f</kbd> to move cursor right one character.
- [x] Use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the entry and exit.
- [x] Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select multiple entries and open them using the quickfix window.(Need the provider has `sink*` support)
    - Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to expand the directory for `:Clap filer`.
- [x] Use <kbd>Ctrl-t</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl-x</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl-v</kbd> to open the selected entry in a new tab or a new split.
- [x] Use <kbd>Ctrl-u</kbd> to clear inputs.

See `:help clap-keybindings` for more information.

### Execute some code during the process

```vim
augroup YourGroup
  autocmd!
  autocmd User ClapOnEnter   call YourFunction()
  autocmd User ClapOnExit    call YourFunction()
augroup END
```

### Change highlights

By default vim-clap will use the colors extracted from your colorscheme, which is not guaranteed to suitable for all the colorschemes. Then you can try the built-in `material_design_dark` theme then:

```vim
let g:clap_theme = 'material_design_dark'
```

![clap-highlights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8850248/72986238-bd106580-3e22-11ea-98ad-03faa9d6130c.png)


You could also set `g:clap_theme` to be a `Dict` to specify the palette:

```vim
" Change the CamelCase of related highlight group name to under_score_case.
let g:clap_theme = { 'search_text': {'guifg': 'red', 'ctermfg': 'red'} }
```

`ClapDisplay` and `ClapPreview` are the most basic highlight groups for the display and preview window, which can be overrided if the provider has its own syntax highlight, then checkout the related [syntax](syntax) file for more granular highlights directly.

If you want to write your own clap theme, take [autoload/clap/themes/material_design_dark.vim](autoload/clap/themes/material_design_dark.vim) as a reference.

See `:help clap-highlights` for more information.

## How to define your own provider

```vim
" `:Clap quick_open` to open some dotfiles quickly.
let g:clap_provider_quick_open = {
      \ 'source': ['~/.vimrc', '~/.spacevim', '~/.bashrc', '~/.tmux.conf'],
      \ 'sink': 'e',
      \ }
```
