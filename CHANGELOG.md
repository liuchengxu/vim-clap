CHANGELOG
=========

## [unreleased]

### Added

- Add `g:clap_preview_size` for configuring the number of preview lines. ([#444](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/444))

## [0.17] 2020-05-25

### Fixed

- Fix the `sink*` args in `selection.vim`, convert the truncated lines to the original full lines.

## [0.16] 2020-05-21

### Added

- Async `on_move` impl for `filer`, `files`, `grep` and `grep2` provider in Rust binary, no delay for the preview function. ([#437](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/437))

### Changed

- Decrease the max number of candidates for running in sync from 100000 to 30000, which means once the total number of candidates is larger than 30000, the async filter will be used, otherwise use the builtin sync one.
- `filer` uses the daemon job which requires the latest binary. Download the latest binary if you uses the prebuilt binary.

### Improved

- Add cmdline completion for all the autoloaded providers. [#429](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/issues/429)
- Run the spinner for dyn filter. [#430](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/issues/430)

## [0.15] 2020-05-02

### Added

- Support substring matcher for dyn filter, used when the query contains space. ([#411](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/411))
- Add progress bar support for the download feature of maple. ([#419](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/419))
- Add instructions for building the Rust binary via Docker in case of some users run into the libssl error when using the prebuilt binary, see more info in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

### Fixed

- Reset handler state. (#418)

## [0.14] 2020-04-25

### Added

- Add new `check-release` command, you can use `maple check-release --download` to download the latest release binary to `bin` directory. And `:Clap install-binary!` will run this command when possible. ([#410](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/410))

### Fixed

- When cmd in `job(cmd)` is a String, the path containing spaces could be problematic on Windows(GVim). Use List instead. ([#407](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/407))
- The positions of matched items in Rust fzy implementation `extracted_fzy` crate is incorrect. The pure Python fzy impl is consistent with the original fzy C implementation. ([#409](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/409))

## [0.13] 2020-04-20

### Added

- New provider `:Clap proj_tags` for project-wide tags.([#391](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/391))
- Allow `:Clap files +name-only` to filter the file name only instead of the full file path. Require you have built the Python dynamic module or uses in the cached mode. ([#389](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/389))
- Add provider `action` property, you can delete the buffer in `:Clap buffers` using the action dialog triggered by `<S-Tab>`. ([#396](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/396))

### Improved

- List all the autoloaded providers instead of the builtin ones in `:Clap providers`.
- Handle the icon highlight offset on Python and Rust side.

### Changed

- Now `:Clap tags` will filter the tag name column only, same with `:Clap proj_tags`.
- Change truncated dots from `...` to `..` for displaying one more useful char.

### Fixed

- Fix installer on Windows and some other job related issues. Thanks to @TissueFluid. ([#405](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/405))
- Add default value when `ClapSearchText` highlight group misses some attributes. #390
- The final result of dyn filter is not ordered, ref https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/385#issuecomment-611616792 .
- Make use of command line `--winwidth` option, fix the unsuitable truncation for long matched lines.

## [0.12] 2020-04-12

### Added

- Add `--content-filtering` in maple. You can use `:Clap files +name-only ~` to filter the file name instead of full file path, but you can only use it when clap is using the cached tempfile inside vim.

### Improved

- icon highlight for truncated grep text.

### Changed

- `grep2` will not match the file path by default. ([#385](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/385))

### Fixed

- `ITEMS_TO_SHOW` is fixed at the moment, only 30 rows can be shown correctly for dyn filter. https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/385#issuecomment-611601076
- Fix wrong icon for dyn filter when the text is truncated.

## [0.11] 2020-04-09

### Added

- New provider `:Clap grep2` with cache and dynamic refresh support. `grep2` is much faster than the previous `grep` provider as it'll reuse the cached contents from previous run and do the filtering with dynamic results. `grep2` is not a typical grep tool but a fuzzy filter tool, for it tries to collect all the output and then filtering on the results. `grep` is merely to dispatch the rg command and show the results returned by rg directly, no fuzzy filter actually. ([#383](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/383))

- Double bang version of `:Clap!!`, shortcut for `:Clap [provider_id_or_alias] +no-cache`, e.g., `:Clap!! files ~` is same to `:Clap files +no-cache ~`.

### Changed

- Change `ITEMS_TO_SHOW` from `100` to 30, `UPDATE_INTERVAL` from 200ms to 300ms. A normal screen can only show about 50 rows, 30 rows should look like the same to 100 rows as the default clap window size is 1/3 of the screen height, but it reduces the overhead of communication between vim and maple significantly.
- Add `using_cache` status to `g:clap_forerunner_status_sign`, the default sign is `*`, which indicates clap is using the cached file which could be outdated. Use `+no-cache` to run without cache and also rebuild the cache accordingly, e.g., `:Clap files +no-cache /`.
- The cache directory name changed to `vim.clap` from `clap_cache` in your system `temp_dir`.

### Improved

- [perf]Try using the cached file when rerunning the same command under the same directory. The cache directory uses https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.temp_dir.html which will be purged when you restart the computer. Or you can use `maple cache --list` to list the current cached info.

### Fixed

- `has('gui_running')` does not work for neovim. [#378](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/issues/378)
- Wrong Vim job stop API usage.([#377](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/377))
- https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/issues/371#issuecomment-610176970
- The postponed preview action can be triggered when the main window is closed. #382

## [0.10] 2020-04-04

### Added

- Add `init` for `Clap grep`, fill the content when query is empty for git repo.([#347](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/347))
- Add `g:clap_popup_border` for adding the border for the preview popup. ([#349](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/349))

### Improved

- Print a note about Rust nightly is requred for building the Python dynamic module.
- Refine the syntax of `Clap lines` with `ClapLinesBufname` and `ClapLinesNumber` group added.
- [perf] Use const table instead of `lazy_static` for the icons, [more info](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/354#discussion_r395975392). Thanks to @ImmemorConsultrixContrarie .
- [perf] Major improvement :tada: support the filter dynamic support, contribution by @ImmemorConsultrixContrarie. ([#364](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/pull/364))

### Fixed

- `Clap filer` always selects the first entry when you narrow down and navigate the list. ([#348](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/issues/348))

## [0.9] 2020-03-10

### Added
