//! This module provides the feature of search based `jump-to-definition`, inspired
//! by https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump, powered by a set of regular expressions
//! based on the file extension, using the ripgrep tool.
//!
//! The matches are run through a shared set of heuristic methods to find the best candidate.
//!
//! # Dependency
//!
//! The executable rg with `--json` and `--pcre2` is required to be installed on the system.
