# Clap Plugins

> WARN: This is an expermental feature, use at your own risk!

Vim-Clap was originally a mere Vim fuzzy picker plugin, however, the integration of a robust Rust backend unveiled the potential to implement various additional functionalities effortlessly, for enjoyable expermentation and potential performance enhancements.

Note that the following plugins may not feature-complete as the alternatives, they are mainly created for the plugin author's uses. Bugs are expected as these plugins are not extensively tested, feel free to use if you are brave enough.
